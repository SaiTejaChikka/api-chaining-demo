API Chaining Demo with React
This project demonstrates how to chain API requests using React. It allows you to fetch a list of users, create a post associated with a selected user, and fetch comments related to the created post. The app is built using axios for making HTTP requests and tailwindcss for styling.

Known Issues
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented, but more specific error messages can be added depending on the use case.
API Limitations: Since this is a mock API, some limitations in data availability and structure may exist.
UI/UX Improvements: While TailwindCSS provides the base styling, more design improvements can be made to enhance the user experience.
